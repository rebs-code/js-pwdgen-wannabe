# Wannabe Password Generator with JS

This JavaScript code is a simple web application that prompts the user to enter their name, surname, and favorite color. It then generates a pseudo-random number and combines these inputs to create a password-like string. The user interface includes a "Start Here" button that initiates the data entry process.

## Usage

Click the "Start Here" button to begin the data entry process.
You will be prompted to enter the following information:

- Your name
- Your surname
- Your favorite color

After providing the requested information, the following actions will take place:

- The name, surname, and color information will be displayed on the webpage.
- A random number will be generated in the range between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- The generated number will be combined with the user's information to create a unique password-like string.
- The combined information, including the password, will be displayed on the webpage.
